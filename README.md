# Smarthub_Responsive_Store_Landing_Page Design Choices Summary
Responsive Four-Column Grid Layout
The product grid uses CSS Grid with repeat(4, 1fr) to display four product cards in a single row on larger screens. Media queries adjust the layout to two columns on tablets and a single column on mobile, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.

Uniform Product Image Dimensions
All product images have a fixed height of 250px and use object-fit: cover, ensuring a consistent and polished visual layout by preventing uneven image heights.

Clean, Minimal UI
The design favors simplicity with a clear header, centered content, and a uniform container width. Rounded corners and subtle shadows on product cards enhance visual separation without clutter.

Modern Interaction Cues
Hover effects on product cards and buttons provide subtle motion feedback. Smooth transitions (transform, background-color, and color) improve interactivity without overwhelming the user.

Color Scheme and Branding
A soft gray background with contrasting cyan headers/footers (rgb(57, 180, 193)) maintains a fresh tech-inspired tone. Buttons and navigation use consistent accent colors for branding.

Responsive Navigation
The header layout adjusts from horizontal to vertical on smaller screens, improving usability. Navigation links adapt spacing to maintain readability and accessibility.
